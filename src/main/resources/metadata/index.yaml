description: "Tasks that compress and decompress files and archives for Kestra flows."
body: "Use ArchiveCompress, ArchiveDecompress, FileCompress, and FileDecompress to package or extract files stored in Kestra, providing the `from` internal storage URI plus an `algorithm` for archives and a `compression` format for both archive and single-file operations. Outputs return new storage URIs (archives also expose an entry map and size/count metrics), making it easy to pass compressed artifacts to uploads or downstream tasks."
